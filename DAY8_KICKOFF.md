# Day 8 Kickoff: Vendure Tenant Isolation & Operator Admin

## 🎯 Overview

**Goal:** Ensure sellers can ONLY access their own channel data and create an operator dashboard to manage all tenants.

**Why This Matters:** Right now, a seller can see ALL channels in the dropdown and potentially access other sellers' data. We need to lock this down!

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Currently when a seller logs into Vendure admin:
- ❌ They see ALL channels in the dropdown
- ❌ They can switch to other sellers' channels
- ❌ No automatic channel isolation
- ❌ Potential data leakage

**We need:**
- ✅ Auto-switch to seller's channel on login
- ✅ Hide other channels from dropdown
- ✅ Prevent API access to other channels
- ✅ Middleware to enforce channel scoping

---

## 📋 Day 8 Tasks

### Priority 1: Channel Isolation ⭐ (CRITICAL)

1. **Auto-Switch Middleware**
   - Detect seller login
   - Look up their channel from tenants table
   - Auto-switch to their channel
   - Lock them to that channel only

2. **API Middleware**
   - Intercept all API requests
   - Add channel filter automatically
   - Prevent cross-channel queries
   - Return 403 for unauthorized access

3. **UI Customization**
   - Hide channel dropdown for sellers
   - Show only their channel
   - Customize admin UI for single-channel view

### Priority 2: Operator Admin Dashboard

1. **Tenant Management**
   - List all tenants
   - View tenant details
   - Manage subscriptions
   - View usage metrics

2. **Monitoring**
   - Tenant status dashboard
   - Provisioning errors
   - Usage alerts
   - System health

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Test 1: Channel Isolation
```
1. Create two sellers (A and B)
2. Login as Seller A
3. Verify: Can only see Seller A's channel
4. Verify: Cannot switch to Seller B's channel
5. Verify: API queries only return Seller A's data
```

### Test 2: API Filtering
```
1. Login as Seller A
2. Query products (should only return Seller A's products)
3. Query orders (should only return Seller A's orders)
4. Try to query with Seller B's channel ID (should fail)
```

### Test 3: Operator Admin
```
1. Login as operator
2. View list of all tenants
3. See both Seller A and Seller B
4. View details for each
5. Monitor status
```
